`「이 바보가!!`
` 당연하잖느냐!!`
` {f:3:첩이 사람을 죽일 때 그대가 짓는 그 표정이 어떠한 홍차보다도 달콤하다는 이유를 제외한 무슨 이유가 필요하단 말인가}?!!`
` 쿳캬하하하하하하하핫!!」`
`「어이 어이, 눈을 감지 말고 자안뜩 보라니깐?`
` 자아, 자아, 자아, 자아!`
` 마법이라고~? 가구라니깐~? 그대가 아무리 첩과 마법의 존재를 부정해 봐도 소용없으니깐 말이지! 어이 어이~ 자아 자아! 보라니까안?!`
` 캿핫핫하하하!!」`
`「미안하지마안, 배틀러어.`
` 상당히 재미있었다고.`
` 그런데 스승님이 말하는 대로 해봤더니 정말로 괜찮지 않은가!`
` 매정하게 츤츤거리다가 적당히 데레데레하면 호감도라는 게 대폭 올라간다고 했었지―?`
` 큭캬핫핫핫핫하!!」`
`그 한적한 소리는 불어닥치는 메마른 바람 소리.`
`{n}장미 덤불 속에서 반짝이는 꽃잎은, 황금색.`
`그 황금의 장미 정원에서 흔들리던 꽃잎과 같이,`
`요란스럽게 날아다니던 황금의 나비들은 이제 어디에서도 찾아볼 수 없었다...`
`황금향의 주인은 황금의 마녀 베아트리체.`
`{n}그녀를 표현하는 말은 잔학무도.`
` 방약무인.`
`{n} 그리고 천진난만.`
`웃으면 웃을수록 그녀의 기품을 떨어트리던 웃음 소리는, ......이제 들을 수 없다.`
`황금의 마녀 베아트리체는,`
` 황금의 장미 정원 못지않게 아름다운 의자에 인형처럼 앉아 있었다.`
`......물론 느긋하게 앉아서 쉬고 있는 것은 아니었다.`
`그 눈동자에는 빛이 없었고,`
` 무엇을 물어도 대답하지 않았으며,`
` 그렇다고 해서 평안하게 자는 것도 아니었다.`
` 베아트리체는, 그저 인형처럼 앉아만 있다......`
`와르길리아는 그녀의 머리카락을 풀어, 빗으로 세심하게 빗어 내린다.`
`만약 헤어스타일에 대해서 이러쿵저러쿵 불만을 입에 올려 주었다면,`
` 그건 틀림없이 평소의 베아트이리라.`
`......그러나 그녀는 아무런 대답도 없었고, 그 어떠한 것에도 반응하지 않았다.`
`{n}그래선 마치 와르길리아가 커다란 인형의 머리를 빗어주고 있는 것으로밖에 보이지 않았다...`
`그 옆에는 테이블이 있었다.`
`테이블 위에는 체스판과 어지러이 놓여 있는 흑백의 말들이 있었다.`
`그러나 그 말들은 체스의 말과는 달랐다.`
`{n}...체스와 비슷한 다른 게임일지도 모른다.`
`그리고 그 옆에는, ......의자에 조용히 앉아서 다음 수를 생각하고 있는 한 청년이 있었다.`
`...아니, 다음 수가 아니었다.`
`때때로 체스판 위에 있는 말들의 위치를 바꿔서 형세를 바꾸고 다시 생각하는 것을 반복한다.`
`과거의 장면을 재현해 놓고는, 그 수에 담긴 의미를 찾고 있는지도 모른다.`
`일찍이...`
`우시로미야가의 당주 킨조는, 체스판의 기보를 읽는 것은 과거의 명인들의 사고를 쫓는 여행이라고 비유한 적이 있었다.`
`우시로미야 배틀러는 그 여행을 떠난 것이다.`
`이 게임판을 만들고, 이런 수를 둔 황금의 마녀의 생각을 쫓는 여행을 말이다.`
`배틀러는 이번 수에 움직인 흑색의 말을 원래 자리로 되돌려 놓고는 깊게 한숨을 쉬었다.`
`배틀러의 말은 흰색이다.`
` 하지만 이 체스판에서는 배틀러가 검은 말을 움직이고 있었다.`
` 그는 베아트의 입장에 서서 판면을 재현하고 있었던 것이었다...`
`「......너의 수는 해 보면 해 볼 수록 이해를 못하겠어.」`
`배틀러는, ...그 물음에 베아트가 대답해 줄 거라고는 생각하지 않았다.`
그러나, ......혹시라도 대답해 줄지도 모른다는 생각에,`
` 혼잣말인 척 입을 연 것이다.`
`베아트의 눈동자에는, ......아무것도 비치지 않았다.^`
`{n}그러니 그 입이 열릴 일도 없었다.`
`「........................」`
`황금의 마녀는, ......스스로를 죽여달라고 간절히 애원한 후에,`
` ...살아가는 것을 포기하고 말았다.`
`잠을 자는 것은 아니다.`
`{n}......게임판에서 나갈 수 없는 그녀에게 잠이란 허락되지 않는 것이다.`
`그러니까 분명히 그 귀에는 들리고 있을 터이다.`
`{n}그러나, ......그녀의 마음에는 더이상 그 말이 들리지 않는 것이다.`
`그러니까 이제 황금의 마녀는 예전처럼 배틀러의 수를 비웃지도, 칭찬하지도, 폄하하지도 않는다.`
`베아트리체는, ......살아있는 인형에, ...지나지 않는 것이다.`
`눈동자는 초점이 없는 채였지만 가끔씩 눈길을 주는 일은 있었다.`
`때로는 몸짓처럼 보이는 것을 해 보이거나, 입술을 움직이기도 했다.`
`그러나 그것으로는 배틀러와 의사소통을 할 수는 없었다......`
`「어떻게 하면 이런 상황에서 이런 수가 나오는 거야?`
` ......이해를 못 하겠어.`
` 네가 이런 수를 둔 이유를.」`
`「.....................」`
`「......베아트.`
` 배틀러 군이 이야기하고 있잖아요...」`
`「.....................」`
`「...뭐라고 말 좀 해봐.`
` 낄낄낄이라든가, 깔깔깔 이라든가.`
` ......평소의 마귀웃음이라도 좋으니까.」`
`......믿을 수 있는가...?`
` 이제 베아트의 마귀웃음을 듣는 일은, ...없을것이다.`
`그러나 대답하지는 못하더라도 소리만은 반드시 들릴 것이다.`
`{n}......그렇게 믿고, 배틀러는 계속 말을 건다.`
`{n}그래서 한 번 더 같은 말을 한다...`
`「어째서 이 상황에서 이런 수를 두는 거야?`
` 이해를 못 하겠어.`
` 어째서 그렇게 움직이는 건지 전혀 모르겠다고.」`
`「............`
`......그 아이의 생각을 이해하지 못하겠습니까?」`
`와르길리아가 제자를 대신해서 대답한다.`
`그녀는 베아트를 대신해서 대답하는 일만은 최대한 피하려고 애썼다.`
`{n}왜냐하면, 베아트가 대답할지도 모르는 기회를 자신이 빼앗고 싶지 않았기 때문이다.`
`......그러니까 배틀러는 베아트가 대답해 줄 때까지,`
` ......언제까지고 참고있어야만 하는 것이다.`
`와르길리아는, ...그런 배틀러를 더는 보고있을수만은 없던 것이다.`
`그리고 배틀러도 와르길리아도 대화를 원했다.`
` 그런 대화들이 베아트의 마음에 반드시 닿는다고 믿고......`
`「그래.`
` 전혀 모르겠어.`
` ......이렇게 베아트의 입장에 서서 말을 움직이면 움직일수록 더 모르겠다고.」`
`비문에 따른 연속 살인.`
` 그것을 승리의 목표로 삼고 마녀의 입장에서 판면을 재현해 봤지만,`
` ......도저히 베아트와 같은 수는 나오지 않았다.`
`승리 목표와는 명백하게 상반되는 이해할 수 없는 수들이, 과거의 판면에 정말로 많이 퍼져있었기 때문이다...`
`「......전혀 모르겠어어.`
` 이 녀석의 생각을 쫓는 여행는 너무나도 험하다고.」`
`「그래도, 당신은 포기하지 않네요.」`
`「그래.`
` .........약속했으니까.」`
`{a:c:`
`나를, 죽여줘.`
` ......죽게 해줘......}`
`"I promised to let her die peacefully.`
` ......And I'm the only one who can do that."`
`...Beato's right ankle was bound with a heavy, cold, steel shackle.`
`It wasn't tied to anything, so it didn't restrict her movement.`
`However, it symbolized restriction.`
` It was a visualization of the restriction that prevented her from leaving the game without either victory or loss...`
`And...the shackle was probably hurting her.`
`{n}The mercilessly cold steel shackle...`
`was tormenting her over and over inside her waking dream.`
`"............Ghh............ah..."`
`So there was never any relief in her empty expression.`
`{n}Her eyelids would sometimes tremble like she was having a bad dream, ...and every once in a while, she would let out a pained gasp.`
`Unless I win,`
` ......Beato will never be released from the curse that prevents her from resting in peace...`
`"...Are you not in a hurry?`
` It seems that the fifth game has already started."`
`"............`
` ......I'm not interested."`
`Why should I take part in any game without Beato as an opponent...?`
`{n}If that's the only alternative,`
` then stepping through past games on a journey in search of Beato's thought process is a much better use of my time......`
`"I'll be the next Game Master.`
` Any objections?`
` You have none, right?"`
`"......I have tons.`
` Beato has abandoned the fight and lost consciousness.`
` Isn't this loss by default and game over for her...?"`
`"I'll admit a lot's happened to Beato, and it feels a teensy bit like she's been knocked out right now.`
` But that doesn't mean she's lost the will to fight.`
` That's why I'm acting as her assistant.`
` Get it?"`
`Beato was lying down on a deck chair, almost as though she was sleeping.`
`However, she wasn't sleeping,`
` ......and she wasn't awake either.`
`She was nothing more than a living doll who had given up on victory, asked Battler to perform her last rites,`
` and entrusted everything to him...`
`Of course, no fifth game would ever be prepared if everyone just sat around.`
`So, {f:5:Lambdadelta} had succeeded Beato as the Game Master,`
` and proclaimed that she would prepare the next game.`
`"Quit messing around.`
` This game is between me and Beato.`
` I don't know who you two are, but I'm not gonna just let you carry on without us."`
`"No one asked your opinion.`
` So, Bern?`
` Do you accept or not?"`
`"..................`
` ......Sure.`
` Go and succeed her position."`
`"What the hell?! How dare you say that!`
` I don't know who you two are, but I'm not gonna let you ignore Beato and me and just carry on by yourselves!"`
`"Calm down.`
` Of course a different player will choose different moves.`
` You might have a lot of reason to feel uneasy about the idea,`
` but even so, it could give you some big hints, right?"`
`"Who cares?!!`
` And who put you in charge?!!"`
`".........Beato's game has repeated four times, and you still don't understand anything, right?`
` In that case, I think that changing the player might lead to some huge hints."`
`"That's none of your business!`
` This is {i:our} game! Beato prepared it, and she designated me to be her opponent in it.`
` I don't know what hole you two crept out of, but I don't want you screwing things up!"`
`".........In that case, wake Beato up and make her get the next game ready.`
` Can you...?"`
`"B‐...Beato won't be getting up for a while.`
` But there's no need for a new game.`
` Just the four games she's already laid out are more than enough!"`
`"Even if there is to be a fifth game, it just needs to be something that Beato lays out and I challenge.`
` You two have absolutely nothing to do with this!"`
`Battler couldn't hide his irritation at these two witches called {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel},`
` who had shown up after the game's start and who had started to try and continue it on their own...`
`It looked like these witches were of an even higher rank than Beato—`
`so high, in fact, that even Beato's master {f:5:Virgilia} couldn't come close.`
`Battler had the feeling that he'd seen these two several times before.`
`However, this was the first time he had learned their names and spoken to them directly.`
`"You can't get the next game ready without waking Beato.`
` That's why I'm going to prepare it instead!"`
`"Listen, Battler,`
` we aren't so patient that we're willing to wait however long we have to for Beato to regain consciousness.`
` Right, Bern?"`
`"............I don't like boredom.`
` It really ticks me off."`
`"We really don't care whether you get bored or not."`
`"Come on now.`
` Leave everything to <perfect> {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama, okay?`
` I'll take over as the Game Master."`
`"{f:5:Don't worry}, I won't play with too much "certain perfection".`
` I'll {i:act all Beato‐like} and prepare plenty of clues, bonus hints, and fakes that make no sense.`
` I'll make it into one big hint to help you understand Beato's world even more, okay?"`
`Letting my voiceless emotions explode, ...I slammed the table hard.`
`The two witches barely flinched.`
`......One grinned.`
`{n}The other looked indifferent, as though nothing had happened.`
`The two of them just stared at me silently.`
`{n}...As though they were reproaching me.`
`"What's this?`
` Not satisfied?`
` Are you saying you'll step down from my fifth game?`
` Isn't that loss by default?"`
`".........Battler won't step down.`
` Of course he'll participate in the fifth game."`
`"Don't just decide that yourself!!`
` I'm not gonna play along with you two.`
` I don't give a shit!"`
`"Hmmm...`
` ......Then it really is loss by default, right...?`
` The witch side wins this game,`
` the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s submit, and we wrap things up, then...?"`
`".........If you step down, then you lose by default and the game ends... Are you okay with that?`
` .........If you want to make certain that your lonely sister...`
`will always meet with miserable circumstances in an endless number of worlds, that option is indeed open to you."`
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} mentioned Ange, .........Battler's expression changed instantly.`
`"H‐......how dare you...`
`talk about Ange so casually......"`
`".........It's because you have me, the Witch of Miracles {f:5:Bernkastel}, as your ally,`
` ...that there exists the possibility of a {i:miracle} in which Ange's family might come home to her."`
`"Well, if you throw that chance away yourself, guaranteeing that Ange's endless futures will all end in sorrow, that might be pretty interesting for me too."`
`I vaguely understood what she was saying.`
`Until I win in Beato's game, I'll remain trapped in this bizarre world.`
`And if I abandon victory, ......then most certainly, my parents and I will never return to Ange.`
`For Ange's sake, ...even though I know that the witches are toying with me,`
` I must keep on fighting...`
`"Nn, ...d‐.........damn......"`
`".........What's wrong?`
` You look unsatisfied.`
` Did you already forget the anger you felt when your sister was turned into mincemeat......?"`
`"That spectacle where she was torn to bits, ripped to pieces by countless red‐hot pliers.`
` Do you need to look at it directly this time......?"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} faced the palm of her right hand upwards.`
`{n}...As she did, a pale light gathered there, ......and some kind of blue‐glowing crystal appeared there.`
`......A scene was reflected on its sharp surface,`
` ...but it wasn't the scene that surrounded them now.`
`If you looked deep into that crystal, ......that fragment,`
` then you would probably learn what was reflected on there.`
`If you stared at it,`
` then you would surely witness that scene where Ange.........finally reached her beloved brother after devoting twelve years of her life to that goal,`
` ......only to have her entire body torn to bits while she was still alive.`
`"D‐......damn...you........."`
`Without thinking, he grabbed at her collar,`
` but as soon as he touched whatever made up her form, it disappeared like foam on the waves.`
`And then, as naturally as though she had been there from the beginning,`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} was leaning against a distant wall.`
`".........If you step down from the game,`
` this will become not just a fragment, but a definite reality.`
` I won't be the one to weave that future.`
` You'll do it yourself.`
` ......So you decide, alright?`
` Figure out what you want to do with your beloved little sister's future."`
`Battler's fists shook with anger,`
` ......but even if he swung them down, he wouldn't be able to hit {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`Like a cat or a phantom, this witch wouldn't even let someone pet her if she didn't wish for it.`
`Besides, ...she's telling the truth.`
`{n}For Ange's sake, I can't step down from this fight.`
`{n}Even if these unpleasant witches hijack the game board.`
`"Ehheheheheh.`
` That's just like you, Be~rn.`
` Even the way you frighten people into doing what you want is heartless.`
` ...That's how it is, Battlerr."`
`"You aren't allowed to step down from the game board.`
` You and Beato are both nothing more than pieces on the game board who exist to distract us from our boredom.`
` ...Even your incomprehensible anger and irritation make for a wonderful treat to sate our boredom."`
`"Well, this level of anger only makes for a cheap snack."`
`".........Like those curry‐flavored potato wafers that sell at 30 yen for a pair."`
`""*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahaha...!!""`
`"Y‐you damn......witches......"`
`".........*giggle*.`
` Fight for Ange's sake, okay?`
` And for Beato's too, right...?"`
`In a way that was admonishing, ...or perhaps babying,`
` ......{f:5:Bernkastel} smiled, tormenting Battler in a similar way to how something too sweet sometimes gives you a headache.`
`The host of this tea party, Beato, was absent now,`
` ......and the guest witches were already making themselves at home.`
`"...What'll you do, Ushiromiya Battlerr?`
` Surrender to faaate...?"`
`".................."`
`"Just step down.`
` You've had enough of being toyed with as a witch's piece, right?`
` Eheheheheh, it's tough being one of Bern's pieces.`
` You'll be a throwaway just like Ange.`
` Geheheheheh!"`
`"I'm not giving you the option of stepping down.`
` ......Keep fighting for the sake of your sister's future.`
` I'm on your side.`
` Until you win, I'll support you so that you can reach that future...`
`for all eternity, until I get bored.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`Battler couldn't allow himself to fall for their provocation and cajolery......`
`These witches knew that he got mad easily, and they were trying to take advantage of that...`
`...Battler withstood it all, ......and finally relaxed his clenched fists.`
`".........If you want to start this fifth game of yours, ...then just do it.`
` Do whatever you want."`
`"Oh, I will.`
` ......Hey, where are you goi~ng?"`
`Even though Battler had acknowledged this fifth game, he turned his back on them,`
` which surprised {f:5:Lambdadelta} a bit.`
`"If you're going to be Beato's substitute,`
` ......then I'm sure that {f:5:Bernkastel} witch over there can be mine if she wants."`
`".........Not a bad idea.`
` Otherwise, this'll turn into a loss by default."`
`"What the heck?!`
` Are you gonna just ignore this Episode 5 that I put so much effort into making?!`
` Rude, ruuude!"`
`"......Battler says he's going to take a break for a while.`
` Until he comes back, I'll be the substitute player.`
` How's that sound...? Battler...?"`
`".........You do that."`
`"............"`
`"......What's wrong, Lambda?`
` If your opponent is me and not that fool Battler, you won't play...?"`
`"Ehheheheheh!!`
` Of course I will{p:0:♪}`
` I'm glad I get to play with you, Be~rn!`
` Come on, let's play, let's play!`
` Let's play together in {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama's super <hyper> and <cute> Episode 5~!"`
`".........This is a world that Beato created, remember.`
` You aren't going to ruin the atmosphere of the story, are you...?"`
`"Don't worry about that.`
` I'm really good at reading between the lines for that sort of stuff.`
` I made sure to use a Beato‐ish atmosphere {i:and} I made it into an even {i:more} interesting story."`
`"Battler, make sure you come back as soon as your break's over, okay?`
` It'd be a shame to miss this.`
` I've prepared plenty of bonus hints that'll get you closer to Beato's secre~t{p:0:♪}"`
`"...Is what it'll look like but I'll actually fill it with misdirection and make things more and more confusi~ng.`
` Wait, hey, Battlerr! Why aren't you listening when a witch is talking?!"`
`Without answering, Battler disappeared into the darkness.`
`After shrugging and cackling,`
` the witches immediately started playing with the game board they had stolen from Beato......`
`"Can those witches really understand Beato's game?"`
`"...Since they're using the same game board, they cannot do anything that this child cannot do.`
` However, they can do things that she wouldn't do."`
`"............`
` ...What do you mean, things she wouldn't do?"`
`"The materials of chess exist to play chess with.`
` You {i:cannot} use them to play cards.`
` However, as for throwing the chess pieces at your opponent, or scribbling on the board..."`
`"Doing such things is not impossible.`
` However, that would be blasphemy against the game of chess,`
` so people {i:don't do that}."`
`"....................."`
`That definitely......wouldn't be chess anymore.`
`{n}It looked like Beato's eyes clouded very slightly with sadness.`
`".........Damn them.`
` .........This game is between me and Beato.`
` ...I won't let anyone else profane it."`
`At that time, gold butterflies gathered and Ronove appeared, holding a tea set with black tea.`
`"Would you like some more tea?"`
`".........If you wouldn't mind."`
`"Certainly.`
` ......So,`
` how has this journey of yours in search of Milady's thoughts been?"`
`"I'm as clueless as ever, but I'm enjoying it."`
`"On a different topic, ......are you certain about this?`
` Relaxing here, I mean."`
`"......Are you talking about the game those witches are playing all by themselves?"`
`"Yes.`
` Just now, when I went to serve them some tea, the murders of the first twilight had already taken place,`
` and it seemed as though the next murder would occur shortly."`
`When Beato and I were playing,`
` the game would be paused whenever someone left their seats.`
`......However, those witches wouldn't pause that game just because I wasn't around...`
`"............Ronove, did you see their game?"`
`"Just a part of it."`
`"How was it?"`
`Ronove lifted the pot high with an elegant gesture as he poured the black tea.`
`After he was done, he finally spoke,`
` expressing his thoughts in very few words.`
`"It did not have...love."`
`"......What do you mean, love?"`
`"My apologies.`
` That is how it would be put if a woman were to say it.`
` ......As a man,`
` ......perhaps one could say it was dishonorable."`
`I understood what those words meant.`
`When I met {f:5:Virgilia}'s eyes, she shook her head slightly and stared at the floor...`
`".........At a glance, I believe it resembles Milady's games greatly.`
` However, the foundation is very different."`
`"Does it go against the rules of Beato's game?"`
`"No, it does not.`
` {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama understands the rules of Milady's game very well indeed.`
` ......However..."`
`".................."`
`Battler stood up.`
`There was no need to make Ronove say any more.`
`"Battler‐kun......"`
`"......Sorry, Ronove.`
` I know you went to all the trouble of pouring this for me, but tea isn't what I need."`
`"You will go after all?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......We don't need any outsiders in our game."`
`...Those guys weren't even here in the beginning.`
`Because I've been loafing about, crazier and crazier witches have been introduced,`
` ......and now they've hijacked this game between me and Beato.`
`"I've got to take it back.`
` ......I'm supposed to be the one taking care of Beato's game board now.`
` ...That means I shouldn't just sit around here."`
`"......Thank you.`
` I wanted to let this child hear those words."`
`"I'm sure she hears them.`
` ......Milady is simply unable to answer."`
`Beato lay there silently, like a living doll with dull eyes...`
`The game board that she had created herself had been hijacked by incomprehensible people and was being turned into a mess...`
`Beato had called on me to be her opponent.`
`{n}Then this game must be something she created for me.`
`{n}I've......got to take it back.`
`"......You just wait here.`
` I'm going to take it back."`
`"....................."`
`Of course, Beato didn't respond in any way.`
` ......That's right.`
`{n}If she can't respond, ...then I have to protect it in her place.`
`"I'll be right back.`
` ......{f:5:Virgilia}, Ronove.`
` ...I'm counting on you two to look after this golden sleeping princess."`
`"Yes. Leave it to us."`
`"......See you later, Battler‐kun.`
` And please,`
` ......try to discover some part of this child in their game without her.`
` If you can,`
` ......then it will mean that you have fought with her, even in her absence."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...Yeah,`
` ......this is no goddamn good at all.`
` What am I doing?"`
`Let's go.`
` ...And let's take it back.`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting, witches!!`
` My break is over!!"`
`When he faced the jet‐black heavens and yelled this,`
` the whole world shattered, as though it were made out of thin glass.`
`Then, ......as though it had been that way since the beginning,`
` .........it transformed into that smoking room where Battler had fought Beato so many times, ...and which the two witches had now hijacked.`
`"What do you think you're doing?`
` You're only coming back now?`
` It's way too late!`
` Not only has the game reached the second day, it's already at the finale!"`
`".........You never showed up, so I just advanced things on my own."`
`Yeah, like you ever even waited for me in the first place...`
`"Bern was waaay sharper and more thrilling than you were. Right?!"`
`"Shut up.`
` I'm the player here.`
` You substitute witches can just take a step back now."`
`".........Well, I don't really mind if you join in starting now, but there's probably no need for you anymore."`
`"Seriously.`
` After all, we're already at the climax!`
` After this, Bern will probably corner me and win."`
`"What the hell.........?!"`
`".........Why not, though?`
` Let's let him watch the final moves."`
`"Yeah.`
` Come on over, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` It's almost completely over, but here's the <cute> and <elegant> game I made!"`
`「에피소드 5,`
` End of the`
` Golden Witch!」`
`지금 현재 섬에는 이 응접실에만 사람이 존재한다.`
`그리고 단 한 명을 제외한 전원이 살인을 범하지 않았다는 것이 드러났다.`
`그리고 이 안에, 범인이 있다.`

` ...이렇게 돼버리면, ...결정난 거잖아...」`
`「마녀가 범인이라서, 마법으로 살인을 한 것이 아닌 이상, 일까...」`
