`「............또...`
`술을 드셨습니까?」`
`청진기를 거두며 노년의 의사는 한숨을 쉰다.`
`먼지와 묘한 단내가 뒤섞인 어두캄캄한 서재에는, 나이 지긋한 남자들의 모습이 있었다.`
`서재라고 부르기엔 너무 넓은 방 한 구석에는 고급스러워 보이는 침대가 있고,`
` 진찰을 받는 남자와 그를 진찰하는 의사,`
`{n}그리고 그들을 지켜보는 고용인인 듯한 남자가 있었다.`
`「술은 내 벗이네.`
` 자네 못지않은 친구이자, 자네보다도 교제한 시간이 길지.」`
`청진기 때문에 가슴을 드러내고 있던 남자는, 흐트러진 옷매무새를 가다듬으며 기죽는 기색도 없이 그렇게 말한다.`
`「............킨조 {c:86EF9C:씨}.`
` ...킨조씨의 몸 상태가 얼핏 좋아 보이는 건 약효 덕분입니다.`
` 하지만, 그런 독한 술을 계속 마셔서는 약도 의미가 없게 돼요..`
` ...여러말 않겠습니다..`
` 술은 삼가하십시오.」`
`「충고해주는 마음만은 고맙게 받겠네,`
` 내 벗이여.`
` .........겐지,`
` 한잔 더 따르도록.`
` 조금 순한 걸로.`
` 난죠의 체면도 세워 줘야지.」`
`「.........괜찮으시겠습니까.」`
` 겐지라고 불린 노령의 집사는, 술을 요구하는 주인과 그것을 말리는 주치의의 양쪽을 살핀후,`
`말없이 살짝 고개를 끄덕이며 주인의 명령에 충실히 따르는 것이었다...`
`그가 찬장에서 준비하는것을 바라보며 주치의인 난죠는 다시금 깊은 한숨을 쉰다...`
`실내를 가득채운 그 냄새.`
`...마음도, 그리고 영혼도 녹여버릴 것 같은 독한 단내는,`
` 주인이 사랑해 마지않는 그 독기 어린 녹색 술의 냄새였던 것이다.`
`「......난죠.`
` 자넨 내가 오랫동안 사귄 벗이야.`
` 지금가지 내 목숨을 부지하게 해 준 걸, 깊이 감사하네.」`
`「제가 뭘.`
` ......의사로서의 충고 따위, 킨조 씨는 전혀 들어주질 않는걸요.」`
`「하하하하...`
` 자넨들 수를 잘못 뒀을 때기다려 달래서 어디 들은 적이 있던가.`
` 그럼 피장파장인 셈이지.」`
`「......주인님.」`
`「미안하네.`
` ......약이 떨어져도 죽진 않지만, 이녀석이 떨여져서는 죽을 것 같거든」`
`체념하는 듯한 표정을 띠는 난죠를 무싷나 채, 킨조는 겐지가 건넨 글라스를 받는다.`
`...한가득 찬 그 독기 어린 색을 보고 그것이 술임을 알아차릴 사람은 많지 않을 것이다.`
`「.........난죠.`
` 솔직하게 말하게.`
` 내 목숨은 앞으로 얼마나 남았나?」`
`「글쎄요...`
` 얼마인지 말씀드리면, 술을 삼가실는지요.」`
`난죠는 다시한번 체념의 한숨을 내쉰다.`
`{n}그리고, 결국은 술을 들이켜는 킨조를 보며 말한다.`
`「........길지는 않습니다.」`
`「...어느 정도로 길지 않다는 겐가.」`
`「..... 이 체스에 빗대오 보죠..`
` 킨조 씨의 끝내기 수순도 꽤 훌륭하긴 합니다만, 제 킹을 끝까지 몰아붙이기엔 역부족입니다.」`
`난죠의 시선에 놓인 사이드 테이블에는 증후한 체스 세트가 올려져 있었다.`
`말드를 보는 한, 게임은 거의 종반에 접어들어 있었다.`
`{n}흑 룩과 비숍이 적진 깊숙이 파고들어 있다.`
`백 킹은 이미 캐슬링 후 궁지에 몰린 상태라, 초보자가 봐도 승부가 나기까지는 그리 오랜 시간이 걸리지 않을 것임을 알 터 였다.`
`이 체스는 난죠가 진찰 일로 방문할 때마다 몇 수씩 진행시켜 온 것이다.`
`그런 판을 가리키며, 결판이 나는 것보다 킨조가 영면하는 편이 빠를 거라 난죠는 단언한다.`
`...그것은 의사로서라기보단, 오랜 친구로서의 말이었다.`
`「............보통의 환자라면,`
` 유언을 쓰길 권장할 시기입니다.」`
`「......유언은 무슨 소린가, 난죠.`
` 내 시체를 어떻게 뜯어먹을지 독수리 떼들에게 지침서라도 써 주란 말인가?」`
`「아니요, 다릅니다.`
` ......유언이란 의사를 남기는 겁니다.`
` 유산 분배 일만을 적는 게 다가 아니에요.」`
`「호오.`
` ......유산 분배 이외의 쓸 얘기란 뭔가.」`
`「............마음에 걸리는 일이나,`
`미처 끝내지 못한 일.`
` 이어받았으면 하는 일이라든지,`
`...전하고 싶은 것.`
` ......어떤 거라도 좋습니다.」`
`「......하.`
` .........이어받았으면 하는 일이나 전하고 싶은 거라고?`
` 어이가 없군.`
` 나 우시로미야 킨조는, 앞으로 남기고 싶은 것도 전하고 싶은 것도 단 하나도 없어!!」`
`「알몸으로 세상에 태어났다.`
` 그리고 알몸으로 죽는다!`
` 바보같은 자식놈들에게 남기고 싶은 것 따위 아무것도 없어!!`
` 설사 죽을 때가 오늘이라도, 지금 당장이라 해도!`
` 난 무엇도 두려워 않고 그 죽음의 운명을 받아들일 것이다!!」`
`「......킨조 씨.」`
`「모든 것을 쌓아올렸다.`
` 부도!`
` 명예도!`
` 모든 것을!!`
` 그것들은 나와 함께 쌓아올려졌으니, 나와 함께 사라질 것이다.`
` 나중에 남겨줄 것 따위 아무것도 없다!!」`
`「아무것도 없어!!`
` 죽은 뒤 일은 어찌 되든 알 바 아니다!`
` 무덤도 관도 아무것도 바라지 않아!!`
` 그것이 마녀와 나의 계약이다!`
` 내가 죽을 때 모든 것을 잃는다!`
` 처음부터 그런 약속이었으니, 무엇도 남지 않는것이다.`
` 무엇도 남길 수 없는 것이다!!」`
`거기까지를 단숨에 뱉어내고는, 킨조는 갑자기 어깨를 축 늘어뜨렸다.`
`...그 표정은, 마치 악령으로부터 빙의가 풀리기라도 한 듯 힘없어 보였다.`
`「..................`
` 하지만 미련은 있지.`
` 남길 것은 아무것도 없지만, 남겨 놓고 떠날 수 없는 게 딱 하나 있네...」`
`「.........그걸 적으면 됩니다.`
` 물론, 살아 있는동안 끝낼 수 있다면 그걸로 좋겠죠.`
` 하지만 혹시 그렇게 못할 때는 남겨진 사람들이 이어받아 줄 겁니다.`
` 자신에게 만일의 사태가 오더라도, 반드시 그 못다 한 일을 이루도록 남겨 둔다.`
` ......그것이 유언이란 거지요.」`
`난죠가 부드럽게 어깨를 두드리려 하자, 갑자기 격양한 킨조가 난죠의 손을 뿌리친다.`
`「안 돼, 안 돼, 안 돼!!」`
`「내가 살아 있는 동안이 아니면 안 된다, 내가 죽으면 내 혼은 곧 게약의 악마에게 먹혀 사라지고 말아!`
` 사후 세계도 안식도 내겐 허락되지 않는단 말이다!`
` 그러니 모든 건 내가 살아 있는 동안이 아니면 안 돼!!`
` 그러니 유언장 따위 내겐 필요 없어!!`
` 그런 걸 쓸 틈이 있다면...`
` 있다면!!」`
`「...난 보고 싶다.`
` 다시 한 번 보고 싶다!`
` 베아트리체의 미소 짓는 얼굴이 다시 한 번 보고 싶다!!`
` 아아, 베아트리체, 어째서 나를 이렇게까지 거부하는 건가!!`
` 이제야말로 네게 받은 모든 것을 돌려주마, 모든 것을 잃으마!!`
` 그러니 마지막으로 다시 한 번만 너의 미소를 보여다오...」`
`「베아트리체, 제발 부탁한다, 분명 들리고 있을 터, 너는 그런 여자다!`
` 부탁한다, 모습을 보여 다오!!`
` 어딘가에 있는 거지?!`
` 다 듣고 있으면서 모습을 숨기고, 지금도 이 방 어딘가에서 날 비웃고 있지?!`
` 내 앞에 다시 한 번 나타나 다오, 그리고 미소지어 다오!!`
` 날 꾸짖어도 좋아, 원한다면 네 손으로 내 목숨을 빼앗아도 좋다!!`
` 이대로 혼자 죽고 싶지 않아!!`
` 너의 미소를 다시 보기 전까진 절대 죽을 수 없다!!"`
` 아아, 베아트리체, 베아트리체!!`
` 이 목숨을 줄 테니, 너에게 줄 테니!!`
` 제발, 베아트리체에에에에에에!!」`
` 「이야.`
` 세상 참 좋아졌네...`
` 단 20분만에 도착한다니 놀랍구만...」`
`머리를 긁으며 시대의 진보에 그저 경탄할 따름이다.`
`{n}이전에는 배였다.`
`니지마 도착까지 꼬박 반나절은 흔들렸어야 했는데 말이야.`
` 편리한 시대가 된 거다.`
`하지만 저렇게 작은 비행기에는 탄 적이 없다.`
`{n}커다란 점보제트기라면 타 봤지만 이런 스몰 사이즈는 처음이다.`
`...역시 흔들리려나.`
` 배도 작은 쪽이 더 크게 흔들린다니까, 역시 비행기도 그런 걸까.`
`...하아, 어디다 빌고 싶은 심정이다.`
`「하하하하, 괜찮아, 배틀러..`
` 배에 비하면 훨씬 덜 흔들리니까.」`
`「우왓, 조, 조지 {c:86EF9C:형}이야?」`
`「헤헤, 갑자기 놀래키지 말라구. 방금 걸로 수명이 3년은 준 것 같으니까.`
` 것보다, 흔들린다니 무슨 말씀이신지?`
` 잇히히히, 난 딱히 비행기도 흔들리는 걸까, 설마 떨어지진 않겠지~라고, 꿈에도 생각 안 했다구?"`
`"Oh, of course not, my mistake.`
` I'm sure that you've changed a lot since we last saw you.`
` After all, it's been six years since then.`
` You're not a kid anymore.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"Sheesh, and here you are, old enough to smoke and drink.`
` I've got no interest in smoking, but I've always wanted to try some booze, heheheh!`
` Well, if you've got your dad's genes, I'll bet you can hold your own when it comes to drinking, right?"`
`"Well, I usually drink for business rather than pleasure.`
` It's pretty hard to do business in Japan without it."`
`"Ihihihi!`
` That's exactly right!`
` So I was thinking I'd take my first shot at it tonight at dinner!"`
`"Th‐that's no good, Battler‐kun, you're still a minor!`
` Drinking alcohol is known to stunt the growth of minors and...`
`...um, never mind."`
`"Come on, I'm tall enough already!`
` In fact, it'd be easier to find clothes if I shrunk a little!"`
`I puffed my chest out proudly.`
`Until I hit my growth spurt, my height was below average in my class.`
`But then, I grew and grew, and before I knew it, I was over 180 cm.`
`I guess I have all that muscle training and those shady mail‐order performance‐enhancing drugs to thank for that.`
`Before then, I'd never dreamed that I'd shoot ten centimeters above George‐aniki, who'd reached his peak height early on.`
`......Damn, I'll bet my relatives all say "look how big you've grown, Battler‐chan!" or something.`
`...That kind of thing is really embarrassing, so I hope they cut me a break.`
`Anyway, my name, "Battler"...`
`...well, it's pretty damn weird, don't you think?`
`I've got to wonder what my parents were thinking when they gave me that name.`
`{n}I've never met anyone who could read it right the first time.`
`I usually get called "{c:86EF9C:Sento‐kun}".`
`{n}Too bad, swing and a miss.`
`My name is written {p:0:右代宮 戦人}.`
`{n}Can you read it?`
` The first part is my family name, "Ushiromiya".`
` That's a fairly plausible Japanese pronunciation so far.`
`The problem is my own name.`
`{n}.........{p:0:戦人} is made up of the characters for "fight" and "person", and it's pronounced "Battler".`
`Put it all together, and you've got Ushiromiya Battler.`
`Pretty crazy, right?`
` It's crazy enough that my parents decided to call me that, but it's even more crazy that some government worker let them make it official.`
` ...Both groups are at the top of my must‐kill list.`
`Anyway, this is one of my cousins.`
`His name is {p:0:右代宮 譲治}, pronounced Ushiromiya George.`
`He's five years older than me, so he's probably turning 23 this year.`
`{n}Since the Ushiromiya cousins consist of two boys and three girls, I ended up playing with George all the time.`
`And because I've always thought of him as a big brother, I still call him "Aniki" today.`
`"Whoo, Battler‐kun, look how big you've gotten.`
` You know what they say, "leave a boy for three days and you'll hardly recognize him"!"`
`"It must be in his blood, I suppose.`
` Rudolf wasn't that tall either until around his high school years.`
` Perhaps people end up taller if their growth spurt comes late."`
`"Nah, it's nothing special.`
` A real man needs to be tough on the inside too!"`
`"Exactly!`
` Battler‐kun here knows how it works!`
` Real men win or lose based on what they've got on the inside!`
` Can't ever forget to keep up your trainin' and discipline.`
` You do that, wait verrry alertly for the perfect moment...and strike!"`
`"Now, even I never imagined that I'd become the company president I am today, master of my own domain...`
` Yep, to think I've come this far after starting out penniless and ruined...!"`
`This portly and slightly chubby man...`
`is George‐aniki's dad, Uncle Hideyoshi ({p:0:秀吉}).`
`He's the husband of Dad's older sister.`
`{n}In other words, we're not blood‐related.`
`He's nice to children, sociable all the time, even quick to give out some spending money to us kids—simply put, he's an awesome uncle.`
`He speaks in an odd and very noticeable Kansai‐style dialect seemingly of his own creation, but he's actually a natural‐born Kanto man.`
`Apparently, leaving an impression is everything in the business world,`
` so speaking in a different style than other people is an act that makes him stick out more.`
`......However, I hear that he gets embarrassed when talking within earshot of a real Kansai person, so he switches back to standard Japanese.`
`...I don't really get it, but he's definitely an interesting person.`
`"If only you weren't so quick to brag about your life's story.`
` That's enough for now, I think.`
` I'm sure Battler‐kun's getting tired of it.`
` Aren't you?"`
`"Nope, not at all, hihihi!`
` Nothing wrong with that.`
` I think it's pretty cool for a man to have some stories he can brag about.`
` I don't have anything like that at all."`
`"Oh, really?`
` I'd imagine a man with your looks would leave girls crying left and right, so I have trouble believing that you have nothing at all to brag about..."`
`"Nonononono!`
` Y‐y‐`
`you're joking, right?!`
` Of course nothing weird like that's ever happened to me!`
` In fact, if you know anyone, I'm all ears!"`
`"Oh, I'm sure you do have some stories!`
` ...*giggle* You must tell your aunt all about it later.`
` After all, George never comes to me with anything of the sort.`
` Heheheh..."`
`This is my aunt and George‐aniki's mother, Auntie Eva ({p:0:絵羽}).`
`She's my dad's older sister.`
`{n}She and Uncle Hideyoshi are a pair of jokers, and they've always teased me back as far as I can remember.`
`This sometimes made them a bit hard to get along with when I was small.`
`{n}...That said, I'm currently in the process of discovering that they still are hard to get along with.`
`Even so, George‐aniki's family is interesting and fun, and they seem to get along just fine.`
`......Sheesh, that's pretty much the total opposite of my family.`
`"Battler‐kun,`
` have you seen Rudolf‐san?"`
`"Huh?`
` He headed off to the bathroom a while ago.`
` Is he {i:still} not back?`
` Heh, maybe the poor geezer dropped dead... {c:86EF9C:Namunamunamu}."`
`"That's no way to talk about your own father.`
` Still, this isn't the first time he's taken so long in the bathroom."`
`"Yeah, the guy's always been that way.`
` Does he really have to take a magazine with him every time he needs to take a dump?`
` Oh, what on Earth might he be doing with those?!`
` Ihihi!"`
`"Oh, you don't need to worry about that at all.`
` As long as we're together, I won't be letting him do that on his own."`
`"Hihihi!`
` Oooh, I'll have to get the juicy details later!`
` Sounds like Dad's got his balls in an iron grip."`
`"You know exactly what would happen with that man if I didn't keep a tight grip, don't you?"`
`"Oh, no kidding.`
` You're the only one capable of reigning in that old bastard.`
` As his son, I'm more than happy to let you take over."`
`"Yes, leave it all to me.`
` After all, that's my specialty."`
`This woman is my dad's wife.`
`Her name is Ushiromiya Kyrie ({p:0:霧江}).`
`As you can probably tell from our conversation, she's not my real mother.`
`{n}She's basically my stepmother.`
`My real mom died six years ago.`
`{n}Kyrie‐san is the woman Dad married afterwards.`
`I mean, I'm not a kid anymore.`
`{n}It's way too late now for me to start calling his second wife "Mom".`
`And I doubt she feels like using the word "son" on this massive kid who's no relation to her at all.`
`We aren't little kids.`
`{n}We know there's nothing to be gained by fighting.`
`So, we decided that we wouldn't force ourselves to pretend that we were family.`
`{n}I've decided to act a bit more frank with her, as though she's a friendly neighbor instead.`
`It's much easier to just keep a little distance, instead of forcing ourselves to act all close and making each other uncomfortable.`
`Kyrie‐san has been very open about all this, and thanks to that, we've been able to get along pretty well.`
`As we were capitalizing on Dad being away in the bathroom to badmouth him,`
` the man himself came back, wiping his hands with a handkerchief.`
`"Hmm?`
` Battler."`
`"Hey, what's up, Dad?"`
`"...Owowowowww!`
` Don't pinch my ear, gaah!"`
`"So, you've been talking trash about me with Mom again, haven't you?`
` What makes it so hard to show a little respect for your father, hmm?"`
`"Owowow, owowowowow!`
` Dammit, that hurts, you old bastard!`
` Stretch my ear all you want, I'm still not gonna be able to fly—owwwww!!"`
`"C'mon now.`
` Upwards,`
` upwards,`
` sideways,`
` sideways,`
` round in a circle,`
` back the other way,`
` multiplier maxed out,`
` with an extra x2 on top!`
` Now say "Father, please forgive me for being so rude"."`
`"Like hell I will, go find yourself some members‐only store if you want it that much!`
` Gyaah, let goooo!!"`
`......This old bastard is my dad.`
`{n}I think I'm pretty tall, but Dad's about the same height.`
`It's probably no surprise that Auntie Eva started talking about Dad's blood when she saw my height.`
`By the way, my height isn't the only thing I got from him.`
`{n}It seems having weird names runs in the family.`
`Dad's full name is written {p:0:右代宮 留弗夫}.`
`......Can you read it?`
` Not many could, I'll tell you that.`
`{n}That mess of characters is pronounced "Rudolf".`
`Haha...he must hate Grandfather for giving him that name.`
`Still, that's no reason to pass that weird naming tradition onto me.`
`As the old bastard twisted my ear all over the place, Auntie Eva snuck up behind him and grabbed his ear.`
`"Hey, Rudolf?`
` Don't take your frustrations out on your kid."`
`"Gyaah, that hurts, Aneki..."`
`The scene before me was a perfect realization of the trope of the older sister who deals out punishment to her prankster younger brother despite his size.`
`"I think that's good enough for now, Eva nee‐san.`
` I'll make sure to stretch out his other ear later on."`
`"Oh, my apologies.`
` I must leave some pulling for you to do, Kyrie‐san."`
`"Rudolf?`
` Make sure Kyrie‐san gives you lots and lots of punishment later on, alright?"`
`"You're one to talk, Aneki, bullying your little brother like that."`
`"Hideyoshi nii‐san, I'd like to thank you very much for picking her up.`
` If you hadn't been so generous, she'd still be unsold in the store.`
` You have my gratitude and apologies."`
`"...Hmm~?!`
` Who are you calling "unsold"?"`
`After taking two or three steps back,`
` Auntie Eva unleashed one of her beautiful high reverse roundhouse kicks, which stopped just a centimeter away from the tip of Dad's nose.`
`After starting out with Tai‐chi‐chuan for her figure, Auntie Eva had then developed an interest in the Chinese martial arts.`
` After that, she went through karate, taekwondo, capoeira, ...and what is it she's learning now, again?`
`...Well, anyway, they say a woman's weapons are in her lower body, and that's literally true for Auntie Eva.`
`"Rudo~lf?`
` Did you know that a single direct blow to the side of the head like that would knock you unconscious?`
` Not so long ago, I accidentally connected in a practice match, and my opponent was out cold."`
`"...Sheesh, what a pain.`
` Guess I have to apologize for her tendency to lash out with her feet, too."`
`Dad, completely unfazed, shrugged and smiled ironically at Uncle Hideyoshi.`
`"Wahahaha, never had a brother or sister myself.`
` So, when I see you two bickerin' with each other, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.`
` It sure is nice to have a big family and siblings."`
`"Oh, then why not consider making a little brother for George‐kun?`
` He's already a fine adult who's about to go off on his own, so it might be a good time to have another child."`
`"Hey, have a little sympathy for the new kid and all the pain and suffering he'd have to live through.`
` I'm surprised even George‐kun turned out as well as he did after being born from this sinister sister of mine."`
`"And what an awesome kid he is.`
` Please share some of that with our blockhead of a son someday, will you?"`
`"That's not how it worked.`
` It's thanks to Eva nee‐san's proper rearing that George‐kun became the good, gentle kid he is now.`
` Isn't that right, Nee‐san?"`
`"Oh, come now...heheh, you think so...?`
` Our George still has a long way to go."`
`"Ah, by the way, how's your little Ange‐chan doing?`
` I heard she was vomiting?"`
`"Oh, that's right!`
` And I was hopin' to finally see her face after such a long time.`
` Is she alright?"`
`"She often catches a cold when the seasons change.`
` She's very frail...`
` I did want to bring her along, but we decided to have my family look after her this time."`
`"I think that's a wise move.`
` She'll be on the mend faster if she's not exposed to that toxic head house.`
` A child's health is always more important than an adult's convenience, don't you think?"`
`"I know of some great medicine for vomitin' colds like that!`
` When we get back home, I'll send it over right away, so be sure to give her some!"`
`"Thank you very much, Hideyoshi nii‐san.`
` I'm always in your debt..."`
`...And once the conversation suddenly veered off in that direction, we kids didn't have any chance of butting in.`
`For now, I'm just happy that Auntie Eva gave Dad his just deserts for tugging on my ear.`
`"Looks like we're still waiting for the weather report."`
`George‐aniki pointed at the counter.`
`{n}The "Pending Weather Clearance" sign was still stuck next to the scheduled departure time for the flight we were scheduled to board.`
`According to Aniki, smaller planes are more subject to winds and other effects of the weather,`
` and it's not at all uncommon for flights to be delayed because of that.`
`......Wait a sec, it isn't really going to shake...is it...?`
`From down here on the ground, it just looks cloudy, not windy.`
`...Well, I guess it's different up where the planes fly.`
`"The weather's a bit uncertain today."`
`Auntie Eva was looking at a TV in the lounge.`
`{n}The weather forecast was being broadcast, informing us that a typhoon was approaching the Kanto region.`
`"A typhoon again?`
` ......I guess we're doomed to these, with the family conference being in October every year.`
` Couldn't he choose a better season?"`
`"I agree.`
` I've always hoped we could have it sometime around the Obon festival in mid‐August.`
` In that case, why don't you suggest that to Father and Nii‐san during the conference?"`
`"...Very funny.`
` Why don't you do it yourself?`
` Our brother would never listen to anything I suggested."`
`"No way.`
` It doesn't really bother me that much to have it in October.`
` You were the one who complained about the typhoon, so I said "ask them to change it then",`
` that's all."`
`"I only said that typhoons always come around this time of year.`
` You're the one who said you wanted to move it nearer to Obon."`
`"Well, you said it too last year!`
` Didn't you say that it would be easier to fit into your schedule if we had it nearer Obon?!"`
`"I've never said anything like that."`
`"Oh yes, you did.`
` I certainly wouldn't forget something like that!"`
`"No, I didn't... You're the one saying that all the time!"`
`"Are you aware?`
` Stopping a kick just a hair's breadth away is a very high‐level technique."`
`"Sheesh, women your age should be more proper than that!"`
`Dad and Auntie Eva's argument looks no different from a couple of brats bickering...`
`"I expect that's because, although they normally act as mothers and fathers,`
` they turn right back into kids again when they meet their old siblings at these family conferences."`
`"You're the one who looks like a real adult, analyzing it all calmly.`
` ......I hope I never turn out like that old bastard.`
` I'd much rather end up as an intellectual adult like you, Aniki."`
`"Like me?`
` Oh, I still have a long way to go.`
` I still have very little experience out there in the real world, and I need to work on becoming more bold and sociable.`
` ...I think you've far surpassed me on all of those counts, Battler‐kun.`
` I'm sure you'll outstrip me fast enough when you become an adult."`
`George‐aniki scratched his head and laughed, as though trying to hide his embarrassment.`
`{n}Of course, he was just being humble.`
`Aniki entered a university and became an apprentice at Uncle Hideyoshi's company at the same time, studying both academics and how to become a business emperor in parallel.`
`Then, right after graduating, he got into Uncle Hideyoshi's company as his father's aide, piling up a lot of real‐life experience as he devoted himself zealously to his work.`
`He even has grand dreams, of one day standing on his own and becoming lord of his own domain.`
`Aniki is a real paragon of a man, sparing no effort as he strives towards his goal.`
` It's no exaggeration to say that I really respect him.`
`And then there's me.`
` I'm nothing at all like Aniki.`
`I'm living my happy‐go‐lucky idle high‐school life to the max.`
`I've got no dreams for the future!`
`{n}I'd like to just sit back, stay cool, and let the money flow in, but of course that could never happen.`
`...When Aniki was my age, he had already formed an impressive objective and had started devoting himself towards studying for that goal, so I guess I can't compare at all.`
`My dad just says "sure you can study at my company, if you like cleaning toilets".`
`Dammit, I'm not gonna be in the debt of that old bastard.`
`{n}I'll find my way myself!`
`{n}.........I guess that intensity is my one qualification towards adulthood.`
`Should I go on one of those self‐searching journeys that are all the rage these days?`
`{n}......Well, it's not like I could mooch off my parents for that kind of money...`
`"......hm?! Ohh~!"`
`Right then, Uncle Hideyoshi shouted out loudly.`
`{n}Uncle's a really nice person on the whole, but he does have a problem controlling the volume of his voice.`
`When I looked over, I saw that he was greeting Auntie Rosa, who had come late.`
`"Ohoooooooooh!!!`
` If it isn't Rosa‐san!`
` Maria‐chan, long time no see!!"`
`"Long time no seee!`
` Uu!"`
`"Maria!`
` Shouldn't that be "It's good to see you again"?`
` Greet your uncle properly."`
`"Uu.`
` It's...good to see you again..."`
`"There you go!`
` Well said!`
` How about some candy as a reward?!`
` ......Oh, huh?`
` Where'd I put 'em..."`
`"Rosa‐san, it's good to see you again.`
` It's good to see you too, Maria‐chan."`
`"It's been too long, Kyrie nee‐san, Hideyoshi nii‐san."`
`"...And...`
`...oh my, Battler‐kun?!`
` Look how big you've gotten...!"`
`"Ah, come on, hahaha...`
` It's embarrassing hearing that from every person I meet...!"`
`"Hey, Rosa.`
` You're late.`
` If the plane was on time, you'd barely have made it..."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` We had some trouble making our train connection.`
` So we're waiting on the weather yet again?"`
`"Oh, don't complain.`
` I much prefer the thirty‐minute plane trip to spending six hours bouncing about on a boat.`
` Even if we're kept waiting here for an hour, it's still much faster overall."`
`"Maria‐chan's gotten huge too!!`
` So, how tall are you now?"`
`"Uu!`
` So, how tall am I now?!"`
`Maria parroted Uncle Hideyoshi's question, looking up at her mother.`
`I guess she doesn't remember her own height.`
`{n}She's probably right in the middle of a growth spurt, so her height must change every month.`
`In just a few more years, she'll probably start looking very feminine.`
`"Umm, ...how tall were you the last time you got measured...?`
` She just keeps getting bigger and bigger.`
` Don't you?"`
`"Uu!"`
`"I think she's grown a lot since last year.`
` Let's see, she turned nine years old this year, didn't she?"`
`"Nine years old.`
` Uu."`
`"That's right, you're nine years old now.`
` Glad to see you're doing well too, Maria‐chan!"`
`"Up you...`
`...nng...`
` I guess you've gotten a bit too heavy to play airplane with..."`
`"George‐aniki, what a rude thing to say to a lady.`
` Here, I'll do it... Up ya go~..."`
`"......Uu."`
`When I went to lift her up in Aniki's place, Maria stiffened defensively, staring suspiciously at my face.`
`...Ah, that's right.`
` The last time I met Maria, it was six years ago, and she was only three years old.`
`Of course she doesn't remember my face.`
`"Maria‐chan, don't you remember?`
` It's Battler‐kun.`
` You used to play together, remember?"`
`".........Uu."`
`"I doubt you'll have any luck.`
` The last time she met Battler, she was only three.`
` You don't keep memories at that age."`
`She must know everyone's face apart from mine because she meets them every year, but I haven't had contact with the Ushiromiya family for about six years now.`
`So, it's no surprise that this nine‐year‐old girl doesn't have any memories of me.`
`Even I can only just barely remember her being a three‐year‐old crybaby.`
`"Maria.`
` This is Battler onii‐chan.`
` Uncle Rudolf's son.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"............Uncle's son is...`
` Uncle's the son...`
` ............??`
` ......Uuuu!!"`
`That "uu" was probably the sound of her brain breaking, unable to understand the complicated explanation.`
`I guess it was a bit too confusing for her.`
`"Maria‐chan.`
` This is Battler‐kun.`
` He's your cousin, like me."`
`"......Like George onii‐chan?`
` ...........................Battler?`
` Cousin?`
` ......Uu."`
`"That's right.`
` You got it."`
`This part of Aniki is what makes me really look up to him.`
`For someone who isn't married, he's just great at dealing with kids.`
`{n}I'm sure that he'll be an indulgent father in the future.`
`"...Battler onii‐chan?"`
`Maria looked straight at me with a questioning expression, as though asking whether it was alright to call me that.`
`"Yep, that's me, Battler.`
` Nice to meet you, Maria!"`
`"Uu!`
` Battler!"`
`"Maria!`
` You mustn't address him without honorifics—call him Battler onii‐chan...!"`
`"It's cool, Auntie Rosa.`
` I don't sweat the small stuff.`
` Right, Maria?!`
` We're buddies on a first‐name basis, us two, aren't we?!"`
`"Battler, Battler, Battleeerrr!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"That's right, Maria, Maria, Mariaaa!`
` Uu‐uu!!"`
`We horsed around for a while to make up for the six‐year gap in our friendship.`
`She probably still thinks of me as nothing more than a big new friend, but things'll probably work out as we get to know each other again.`
`But I'm surprised.`
` She's just the way I remembered her being six years ago.`
`Seems that people just don't change that much after all.`
`{n}I'm a bit happy that she's still the pure, innocent girl I remember.`
`Her name is written {p:0:真里亞}.`
`{n}...That one's not so difficult to read.`
` Of course, it says "Maria".`
`{n}The third character looks like a cross, which is pretty cool.`
`Her feelings don't usually show up on her face, so it can be difficult to know just what she's thinking, but that's just how she looks on the outside.`
`{n}On the inside, she's just a sweet, normal girl.`
`Then there's Maria's mother, Auntie Rosa.`
`{n}She's my dad's younger sister.`
`Rosa is written {p:0:楼座}.`
` ...Here's a name that's totally not Japanese.`
`Sorry to say it, but her name's almost as ridiculous as Dad's...`
` I've got to respect her for not ending up as screwed up as he is.`
`...When I think about it, all the names in my family sound foreign.`
`{n}Just why is Grandfather so obsessed with this?`
`Because of him, even us grandchildren have to put up with this weird naming sense.`
`{n}It's even more annoying since Grandfather's own name is perfectly normal.`
`Anyway, there's one thing about Auntie Rosa that's a relief compared to the other family members.`
`The old bastard and Auntie Eva have this annoying urge to tease and mock people all the time,`
` but even though she shares their blood, Auntie Rosa isn't like that at all.`
`She has the most common sense among all the siblings.`
`Like Uncle Hideyoshi, she's a kind aunt who'll always be on the kids' side.`
`......However, possibly because she's more strict as a parent, she's not liberal with handing out spending money like Uncle Hideyoshi is.`
`Alright.`
` Now we have the entire group of family members who are going to board the plane.`
`As though it had waited for us all to gather, an announcement rang out through the lobby.`
`"Our apologies for the wait.`
` Boarding will now commence for flight 201 to Niijima.`
` We ask that the passengers please form two lines in front of the counter, behind the white line."`
`"Rosa, you still haven't gone through boarding procedures, right? Hurry up."`
`"Oh no...!`
` Maria, come on!"`
`"Uu!"`
`We had to go through a metal detector before going out on the runway.`
`Our small plane wasn't as massive as an international flight, but it was still a plane.`
` A staff member holding a metal detector checked us all.`
`Once all of us cleared the check, we followed the staff member out onto the runway.`
`Come to think of it, everyone here is in the Ushiromiya family.`
`It's like this is a reserved charter flight or something.`
`Our group stopped in front of the entrance to the airplane.`
`{n}Then, our guide turned around and spoke, looking down at the passenger list as she did.`
`"Boarding will now commence.`
` As I call out the names on the passenger list,`
` please take your seats in order, starting from the front row on the right side and going right to left, then onto the next row.`
` I will now begin reading the passenger list.`
` Ushiromiya Hideyoshi‐sama!"`
`"Oh, I'm first!`
` Right here!`
` ...By the way, do you have the candies, Eva?`
` I've been lookin' all over for 'em, but I can't find 'em."`
`"Ushiromiya Eva‐sama."`
`"They're in my handbag.`
` I'll get them once we're inside the plane."`
`I've heard that candies are a good way to protect your ears from hurting due to variations in atmospheric pressure when landing or taking off.`
` That's probably what they're talking about.`
`"...Hope I get a window seat!"`
`"Hahaha, don't worry.`
` There aren't any other kinds of seats."`
`According to George‐aniki, there are apparently only two lines of seats.`
`Yep, it's a small plane alright...`
` .........It isn't really going to shake...is it...?`
`"Ushiromiya George‐sama."`
`"Right here.`
` Don't worry, Battler‐kun.`
` It won't shake too much."`
`"Ushiromiya Battler‐sama."`
`"A‐Aniki, how much is "not too much"?!`
` You can just swim if you fall from a boat, but if a plane crashes you're screwed, right?!`
` We all get our own parachutes in our seats, don't we?`
` Wait, we don't?!"`
`"Ushiromiya Rudolf‐sama."`
`"Come on, Battler, quit being a wuss and get in."`
`"Ow! Dad!`
` Don't push me!`
` We don't get parachutes!"`
`"Ushiromiya Kyrie‐sama."`
`"Alright, stop fooling around.`
` Let's move along."`
`"Ow! Kyrie!`
` Don't push me!`
` This blockhead isn't moving forward!"`
`"Ushiromiya Maria‐sama."`
`"Uu!`
` Forward, forward!"`
`"Ushiromiya Rosa‐sama."`
`"Maria!`
` Keep quiet..."`
`"This is your pilot, Kawabata.`
` We'd like to thank you for taking New Tokyo Aviation's flight 201 today.`
` We estimate that the flight to Niijima Airport will take about twenty minutes."`
`"We are receiving reports of atmospheric turbulence.`
` There might be some shaking of the aircraft, so we ask that you do not unfasten your seat belts after takeoff."`
`"A‐Aniki, did that guy just say we needed to wear seatbelts?!`
` In a jumbo jet, they let you undo them after takeoff!`
` So it's gonna shake so much we can't take them off?!"`
`"Dammit, you tricked me, it is going to shake after all!`
` Where are the parachutes?!`
` I knew I should've taken the boooooaaaaat!!"`
