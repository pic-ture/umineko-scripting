`「.........역시 배가 나았어..,`
`......배가......」`
`「떨어진다─!`
` 떨어진다─!`
` 우─우─우─우─!!」`
`「마리아, 이제 적당히 하렴!」`
`「......하지만 의외인걸.`
` 배틀러는 무서울 것 하나 없을 줄 알았는데.」`
`「이 자식은 옛날부터 어째선지 탈것을 무서워 해서 말야.`
` 입만 벌리면 떨어진다, 가라앉는다 하질 않나.`
` 사내놈이 그게 뭐냐, 너는.」`
`「......시끄러.`
` 아무리 그래도 저건 너무 흔들리잖아...`
` 소형기를 타는 건 처음이라 조금 정신이 없었던 것뿐이라구.」`
`「그 난리를 피워 놓고 조금이라구?`
` 우후후후, 배틀러랑은 해외여행 같이 가면 재밌을 것 같은데.`
` 고모하고 이집트라도 가 볼래?`
` 14시간이나 비행기에 탈 수 있다구.」`
`「아하하하!`
` 좋은 제안이네요.`
` 배틀러 군, 고모한테 좀 단련받도록 해.`
` 그나저나 정말 웃겨!`
` 아하하하하!`
`「와하하하, 보소, 사람은 누구나 잘 하는 거도 몬 하는 거도 있는 기라.`
` 그래 웃으면 미안하제.`
` 와하하하하...!」`
`「아, 아버지도 웃으시면 안 되죠.`
` 마리아, 너도 이제 웃으면 안 돼.」`
`「이제 웃으면 안 돼?`
` 우─!」`
`젠장 젠장!`
` 비행기 잘 못 타는 게 그렇게 잘못이냐.`
`{n}모두들 나를 멀대 같은 놈으로 생각할 게 뻔해...`
` 쳇!`
`공항에서부터는 택시에 나뉘어 타고서, 우리는 항구에 도착했다.`
`{n}여기서부터 배로 섬까지 향하는 거다.`
`바로 근처 섬이니까 먼 거리는 아니다.`
`{n}배로 느긋하게 30분 정도 걸린다.`
`섬으로 향하는 배가 정박해 있는 부두에 가니 손을 흔들고 있는 누군가의 모습이 보였다.`
`「조지 오빠!`
` 오랜만이구만!!」`
`「아, 제시카, 1년 만이네!`
` 키, 또 자란 거 아니니?」`
`「꺄하하, 그만둬, 매년 듣는 건 부끄러우니까!」`
`「......저, 저기 형, 거짓말이지?`
` 이 녀석이 정말로 제시카란 말야?!」`
`「그렇다는 건 조지 오빠...`
` 이 덩치 큰 놈이,`
`...배틀러라구?!」`
`서로가 말똥말똥 상대를 관찰한다.`
`...내 기억 속에 이런 누님의 모습은 없지만, 이 {c:86EF9C:거친 말투}는 분명하게 남아 있다.`
`「여, 제시카!`
` 뭐야 너!`
` 거짓말이지, 무슨 여자 같은 꼴을 하고 있냐!`
` 이건 뭐야 가슴이냐, 너한테도 가슴 같은 게 다 나오냐!`
` 잇히히, 만지게 해줘, 만지게 해줘!」`
`「까불고 있네, 이래봬도 꽃다운 18세니까!`
` 머리도 놔두면 길듯이 나올 덴 저절로 나온다구!`
` 너 같은 놈한테 만지게 할 가슴이 있을 것 같냐!`
` 배틀러야말로 뭐야, 바보같이 덩치만 커져 갖고!!`
` 힘은 좀 쓰냐?!」`
`「까불지 마, 그 이후로 얼마나 단련했는지 뼈저리게 깨닫게 해 주지!!」`
`「짜증난다구!!`
` 되받아 쳐주마!」`
`이 건방진 녀석은 우시로미야 제시카.`
`......나와 마찬가지로 불행의 별 아래서 태어나 묘한 이름이 붙여진 가련한 동료다..`
` 아무튼, 朱志香이라 쓰고 “제시카”라 읽는다.`
`제시카는 우리 아버지의 형의 딸에 해당한다.`
`그 형이란 사람이 우시로미야 가의 장남이기 때문에, 일단 제시카는 우시로미야 가의 직계 후계자가 되는 셈이다.`
`제시카와는 동갑이라는 것도 있고, 또 남자애와 여자애 사이의 으르렁거림 같은 것도 있고 해서,`
` 옛날부터 친척들이 모일 때면 다투거나 장난치는 사이였다.`
`제시카 쪽이 성장이 빨랐던 것도 있어 체격이나 완력은 항상 밀렸었지.`
`그러다 보니 이런 식으로 맞붙어 힘겨루기가 되면 대개는 제시카의 페이스였다.`
`그러니 이렇게 내 쪽이 몸집이 커졌다는 걸 확실히 알아도, 아직 완력으론 제시카에게 못 당할 것 같은 착각을 하게 된다.`
`「흠! 그으으으......!!」`
`「............우오...오...!`
` 뭐야, 뭘 진짜로 하고 그러냐...?!`
` 아야야야...」`
`「어이 어이, 힘 하나도 안 줬는데?`
` 제시카 너, 약해졌구만.」`
`「시, 시끄러워.`
` 나도 여자란 말야.`
` 언제까지고 완력으로 남자에게 이길 리가 없잖아!」`
`「뭐〜 그것도 그렇네!`
` 내가 팔뚝을 키운 만큼 넌 가슴을 키웠단 말이지〜`
` 내 팔과 네 가슴이라면 겨루기 좋을 것 같은데〜?!」`
`「그러니까 너한테 만지게 할 가슴 따위 없다고!!`
` 것보다 너야말로 어때, 귀여운 코끼리 아저씨도 네 키만큼 좀 커졌냐〜?!」`
`「바보야 그만둬, 어머, 치한이야〜 시집 못 가게 된단 말야, 사타구니 만지지 말아 줘〜!!」`
`「누, 누가 들으면 오해할 소리 하지 마!!」`
`솔직히, 이렇게 소란피우면서 얼버무리지 않으면 안 될 만큼 여성스럽게 성장한 제시카에게 놀랐다.`
`......그도 그럴 것이, 6년 전의 골목대장 같은 모습을 떠올린다면 누구라도 놀랄 수밖에.`
`하기야 그건 제시카도 마찬가지겠지.`
`{n}완력으론 아직 지지 않을 거라 생각했을 거다.`
`그러다 이렇게 간단히 져 버렸으니, 저쪽도 내가 그간 6년 동안 너무나도 성장한 것에 놀라고 있을 거다.`
`.........6년인가.`
` 새삼 나는 짧지 않은 세월의 공백을 깨닫는다.`
`「이런 이런..., 완패구만.`
` 이제 더는 나 가지곤 못 당하겠는데.」`
`「그렇지도 않아.`
` 배틀러에게도 분명 약점은 있어.`
` 그렇지, 마리아?」`
`「우─!`
` 떨어진다─ 떨어진다─!!」`
`「컥, 바보야 그만둬, 마리아〜, 그건 비밀로 해 달라구.」`
`「떨어진다아?`
` 뭐야 그게.」`
`「헤헤에!`
` 유감이지만 이 약점은 제시카가 더 이상 볼 일 없다 이거야.`
` 아무튼 악몽의 하늘길은 이미 끝났으니까!`
` 앞으론 느긋하게 참방참방 바닷길 떠나는 일만 남았네.`
` 저 고물 고기잡이배가 이 정도로 사랑스러워질 거라곤 생각도 못 했어.`
` 잇히히!」`
`「뭐어???`
` 조지 오빠, 얘 머리 어떻게 됐어?」`
`「곧 알게 될 거야.`
` 곧 말이지.」`
`형이 싱긋싱긋 웃는 이유를, 나는 이 시점에선 이해하지 못하고 있었다...`
`「이게 누구십니까......, 하아!`
` 배틀러 도련님도 많이 크셨군요...!」`
`이번엔 누구지?`
` 앞치마 차림의 할머니였다.`
`{n}.........아, 아아 아아, 그립구만, 기억났다!`
`「배틀러, 기억하니?`
` 왜, 가정부 쿠마사와 씨잖아.」`
`「쿠마사와 할머니는 잊을 수가 없지!`
` 뭣보다 6년간 조금도 늙지를 않았잖아〜`
` 오히려 더 젊어진 거 아녜요〜?」`
`「홋호호!`
` 요새 들어서 피부가 탱탱해져서 말이지요〜!`
` 보십시오, 가슴도 점점 더 커지고 있습니다요?`
` ...만져 보시겠습니까?」`
`「무, 무슨 농담을!`
` 제가 만지고 싶은 건 탱탱한 누님들 가슴으로 한정돼 있다구요!」`
`「저 또한 젊을 적에는 참으로 탱탱했습니다요〜?`
` 자 자, 부디 마음껏 만져 주십시오!」`
`「헉, 좀 참아 줘요!`
` 젊은 누님이라구요 젊은 누님!`
` 쿠마사와 할머니가 아니라고요!」`
`제시카와의 질 나쁜 장난을 그대로 되돌려 받았다.`
` 그러고 보면 옛날부터 이렇게 곧잘 놀려먹는 사람이었지.`
`「어이 어이, 그만둬요, 쿠마사와 씨.`
`오늘 내일하는 양반이 뭘 들떠서 그럽니까.」`
`「젊으신 분과 농이나 주고받는 것이 회춘에는 더없이 좋은 약입지요.`
` 홋호호!」`
`「쿠마사와 씨가 마중을 오다니 별일이네요.`
` 무슨 바람이 분 걸까요?`
` 뭐 시키면 언제나 허리가 아프신 분이.`
` 후훗.」`
`「홋호호, 에바 님도 여전히 가차 없으시구만요.`
` 급히 장볼 일이 있어서 말입죠, 그 김에 여러분들 마중을 나오려고 생각했습니다.`
` 사실 저승사자 마중이나 기다리는 늙은이가 마중 나와서는 기분도 썩 좋지 않으시겠지만 말이지요.`
` 홋호호...!」`
`술술 잘도 비꼬는 말을 하는 큰고모지만, 쿠마사와 할머니도 역시 연륜이 깊다.`
` 술술 잘도 태연하게 받아 넘긴다.`
`뭐 이렇게 말하면 좀 그렇지만, 쿠마사와 할머니는 고용인으로 일하기엔 이미 때를 넘겼는지도 모른다.`
`건강한 듯 행동하곤 있지만 사실 두통이다 요통이다 해서 몸이 말이 아니다.`
` 솔직히 말해서 아직 근무하고 있는 것만으로도 대단할 정도다.`
`...올해로 연세가 몇이더라?`
`{n}잘하면 80도 바라볼 터이다.`
`{n}그런데도 이만큼이나 정정하게 행동하는 데에는 입이 벌어진다.`
`「점점 더 건강해 지시는 것 같아요.`
` 맞다, 이거요.`
` 전에 말씀드렸던 차예요.`
` 보세요, 사 왔어요.`
` 나중에 한 번 드셔 보세요.」`
`작은고모는 짐 속에서 선물이 든 주머니를 꺼냈다.`
`작년에 만났을 때 사 오기로 약속한 모양인데, 그걸 꼼꼼이 기억하여 의리 있게 지키다니.`
` ...이런 성실한 면은 작은고모답다.`
`약속은 잊지 않고 또한 어기지 않는 사람이다.`
`쿠마사와 할머니는 일 년 전의 약속을 기억해 준 것뿐만 아니라 고용인인 자신에게까지 선물을 가져와 준 것이 무척 감격스러운 모양이었다.`
`이 할머니는 쿠마사와 치요 (熊澤チヨ)씨.`
`우시로미야 본가에 근무한 지 벌써 몇 년도 더 된 고참 고용인이다.`
`{n}역시 고령이다 보니 육체 노동은 특기가 아니지만, 부엌일부터 시작해 청소, 세탁 등 뭐든지 소화해 내는 슈퍼 고용인이라는 것 같다.`
`흠이 있다면 농땡이 피우는 버릇이 있단 정도일까.`
`힘쓰는 일이나 성가신 일은 지병이네 어쩌네 하는 핑계를 대며 잘 빠져나간다고 한다.`
`......농땡이라기보단, 쿠마사와 할머니의 경우엔 뺀질뺀질 요령 피우는 게 능숙하다고 해야 하는 걸지도 모르겠다.`
`...급료를 지불하는 측에선 참고 넘어갈 일이 아니겠지만.`
`뭐, 그런 식으로 살살 넘어가려는 것도 어째선지 밉지 않다.`
`분명 항상 미소가 끊이지 않는 그 밝은 모습 덕일 거다.`
`"Hey, glad to see you're still in fine spirits!`
` How's your back doin' then?"`
`"Even with the medicine, it's not getting one whit better.`
` According to the doctor, nothing can be done for this one.`
` It's what's called an incurable disease, hoh‐hoh‐ho!"`
`"Blows me away how you've just kept getting prettier, Jessica‐chan.`
` Be glad you ended up like Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"R‐really...?`
` Personally, I don't think I look like her at all...`
` I mean, I don't even want to be like my parents.`
` 'Cause I got zero respect for 'em."`
`"Now, you shouldn't say such things.`
` *giggle*, it's amazing how many people don't want to be like their parents in our family."`
`"Ah, that's me!"`
`"Hell no, don't you dare start taking after me.`
` Your nose looking like mine already pisses me off."`
`"What are you talking about?`
` It's ridiculous how completely alike you are—and like your father."`
`"Come on, you can't be serious...`
` Just how am I like Dad?"`
`"You're his copy in arrogance and self‐importance.`
` Father's blood is especially strong in you and Nii‐san.`
` Wouldn't you say, Rosa?"`
`"Oh, absolutely.`
` Krauss nii‐san and Rudolf nii‐san are almost unbelievably like Dad."`
`"Alright, alright already, why am I the only one under fire from the girls?`
` Hideyoshi nii‐san, please help me out."`
`"My my, Rudolf‐kun, you're always so popular with the ladies.`
` I'm jealous!`
` Wahahahaha!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` As usual, you're popular enough to make me jealous.`
` Well then, everyone, shall we head over to the boat?`
` Come now, Maria‐san, let's get on the boat together, alright?"`
`"Get on the boat together.`
` Uu!`
` Everyone gets on together.`
` Uu!"`
`"Hell yeah, this time around I'm not gonna be scared.`
` I'm used to being shaken by the waves.`
` With that piece‐a‐junk fishing boat, I'm less afraid of the shaking than the engine breaking down and the boat drifting off."`
`"Oh yes, Battler‐kun, I forgot to tell you.`
` ...That fishing boat was completely decrepit, so it was taken out of use a few years back.`
` Now we get taken to the island in another boat."`
`"Ohhh, right.`
` It's Battler's first time in the new boat!`
` It's super comfy!`
` And frickin' fast!`
` It can go at crazy high speeds!"`
`"Ohhh...`
` That means less trip time, right?`
` That sounds great!`
` I mean, a boat might be better than an airplane, but if you're telling me we can spend even a little less time exposed to the danger of sinking, that's really just awesomely great~."`
`"...Uu.`
` Is Battler gonna faaall gonna faaall again?"`
`"That's only on airplanes.`
` Everything's fine now!"`
`"You know, it's apparently a modded high‐speed boat, the captain's pride and joy!`
` Seems he's tinkered with it quite a lot—`
`he was going on about how he attached four high efficiency propellers to it, and now it can break 40 knots, or something like that.`
` He bragged to me so much I ended up memorizing it."`
`"Me too; I remember since we're told about it every year.`
` The captain said that since he lost a speed contest with a foreign fishing boat a long time ago, he became obsessed with modding.`
` He told us how his opponent back then could go at over 30 knots, even though it was only in a fishing boat."`
`"To fulfill his thirst for a revenge match, he created an awesome whole new super high‐speed modded boat.`
` I'm sure you'll just love it, Battler."`
`...S‐super high‐speed modded boat...?`
`......My first thought was that this would be much better than some beat‐up boat that might sink at any time......`
`but for some reason, I'm getting this feeling of foreboding...`
` ......Nah.`
`"Hey, Battler, maybe you should just swim to the island."`
`"Battler‐kun, you shouldn't lean over the railing too much.`
` You might fall."`
`"Uu‐uu!!`
` Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!"`
`"Daaaaammiiiiit...so this is why you were all grinning before!"`
`The super high‐speed boat, said to have been modded to hell and back by its captain as a personal hobby, was definitely nothing like the battered old fishing boat from six years ago.`
`"Whooooooooa, it's shaking it's shaking it's shaking!!`
` I'm gonna fall gonna fall gonna fall!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Gonna fall gonna fall gonna fall!!"`
`"If I fall I'll be in the sea, I'll drown goddammit—where's the parachute—no, wait—where's the buoy?!`
` Gimme a life jackeeeet!!"`
`"Waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!`
` What the hell, Battler, what's that supposed to be...waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"`
`"Jessica‐chan, Maria‐chan, it's not nice to tease.`
` Battler‐kun, if you're scared, then just don't come out on the deck.`
` I think that if you stay inside the boat, you'll be a bit less afraid."`
`"Heheh, that's a no‐thank‐you, Aniki!`
` Shipwreck victims are always the ones inside the boat.`
` The survivors are usually those on the deck during the accident.`
` So I'm staying right here!!"`
`"But, it's shakiiiiing!!`
` I'm falliiing!!`
` Whooooaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Shaking falliing!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Maria, I told you to behave yourself!`
` ......But Battler‐kun, it looks like you really can't handle it...`
` I'll go tell the captain to slow down for you."`
`"Whooooa, Auntie Rosa, thank yooooouuuuu!`
` Even on the sea, exercise safe driving, reduce speeds, point and caaaall!!"`
`"*cackle*!`
` Don't do that, Rosa.`
` Ordeals are necessary for the young.`
` Right, Battler‐kun?`
` You can conquer this much, no problem at all, right?`
` Otherwise, you won't be able to go to Egypt with your aunt!"`
`"Whooooa, Auntie Eva, you're meeeeeeeeaaaan!`
` Ooh noooo, I'm gonna faaaaaall!!`
` Life jackeeeet, parachuuuute!!`
` Whoooooooaaaaaaahh......!!!"`
`"N‐no, okay, turn it over and think that way!!`
` What's the enemy aiming for?!`
` He wants to make me afraid like this?!`
` If that's what he's aiming for, too bad, like hell I'll be scaaaaaaaared!!`
` But stooopp iiit, I'm gonna faaaaaaall!!!"`
`...So, after I made a huge fool of myself for a while,`
` Auntie Rosa had a talk with the boat captain, and he slowed down to a more manageable speed for me...`
`"............Hahh...`
` This speed is a bit better...`
` .........Earlier, I didn't even feel alive......"`
`The new speed, which I was capable of tolerating, was apparently extremely slow.`
`...But that just now was completely insane...`
`The whole boat was shaking!`
`{n}Sliding and leaping on the ocean's surface!`
`{n}It felt like I was riding on the back of a flying fish...`
`Jessica was still guffawing at me as I leaned against the railing, tired and disheartened.`
`"I lost in that strength contest earlier, but I'm glad to know I've got the edge where it really counts.`
` But seriously, pfffahahahahah!"`
`"Dammit...go ahead and laugh.`
` One of these days, I'm gonna find your weakness and I'll get back at you...and then your boobs will be mine to squish......"`
`"Ahahaha, well, we'll see about that if you ever do find it, okay?!`
` Waah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"`
`"Uu.`
` Battler, all worn out."`
`"Yeah, Battler, all worn out...`
` I want to die on land, not in the ocean or the sky..."`
`Maria was patting my back, so I patted her head in return.`
`...Her expression was blank, as usual, but I realized that she wanted to console me.`
`"Battler‐kun, the captain is throwing in drinks to make up for this.`
` Have a drink and take a break, why don't you?`
` To calm yourself down."`
`George‐aniki and Kumasawa baa‐chan brought us each an ice‐cold drink with drops of moisture on the can.`
`Judging from Kumasawa‐san's big grin, our parents inside the boat were probably all rolling around laughing at my moment of pure terror.`
`Dammit, I'm so embarrassed that I can't bear to face any of them...`
`If I didn't change the subject somehow, I had the feeling I'd be the butt of everyone's jokes for the whole trip, so I tried to think of something harmless to talk about.`
`"...Hey, Jessica.`
` How are Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi doing?"`
`"My old man and my mom?`
` Unfortunately, they're fine.`
` Though every other word out of their mouths is "study, study", which pisses me off.`
` I'm so jealous, 'cause it doesn't look like Uncle Hideyoshi or Uncle Rudolf say those kinds of things."`
`"Hahaha, oh no.`
` When I was slacking off during exams, I was always getting told "exams, exams".`
` I thought it was annoying, but now I'm grateful."`
`"Hah, I knew it, George‐aniki is magnanimous as ever...`
` As for me, I have to look after myself.`
` No one says a thing to me!`
` Well, it's not like I'd listen if they did, hihihi!"`
`"Battler‐san, have you still not returned to your birth home?"`
`"...Well, I kinda go back now and then.`
` I still have lots of clothes and stuff left at the previous house."`
`"......Uu?`
` Battler has two homes?"`
`"Uh,`
` .........hmmm.`
` ......Something like that."`
`"Why?`
` Why do you have two homes?`
` Uu?`
` Uu?"`
`Only Maria, who couldn't really grasp the situation, voiced her naive question.`
`However, the others just shot nervous glances at me, choosing not to respond even though they knew the answer.`
`"Maria!`
` Look, you can see the harbor now...!`
` Look, over there!`
` Can you see it?!"`
`"Uu!`
` Saw the harbor, saw the harbor!"`
`Apparently, Jessica was trying to be nice by changing the subject.`
`......Ah, well.`
` I'd rather not talk about it if I can help it, but it's uncomfortable to have it treated like some kind of weird taboo.`
`......I don't mind that much myself anymore.`
`I am an Ushiromiya,`
` but the truth is that, for the past six years, I've been living with my grandparents on my late mother's side, and I've even been using her family name.`
`When those grandparents passed away one after the other, I'd basically had no choice except to go back and live with the old bastard.`
`Don't get me wrong. I didn't just run away from home or anything like that.`
`{n}The only one at fault here is my dad.`
`......I don't really blame Kyrie‐san.`
`{n}Being able to hold that old bastard's reins and ride him out is no mean feat.`
`...But as for the betrayal that the old bastard inflicted on my mom...`
` ......Well, unfortunately, I still haven't fully gotten over that.`
`"*ahem*.`
` We'll be getting there soon."`
`George‐aniki cleared his throat, trying to change the topic.`
`"......Please forgive my indiscretion.`
` It seems this old woman has said too much already.`
` If I have hurt your feelings—"`
`"Heheh!`
` I don't mind it and no one's feelings are hurt.`
` Don't worry, Kumasawa baa‐chan."`
`Kumasawa‐san seemed to regret speaking out of turn,`
` but I was more concerned about being worried over for something like that, so I stood up and passed it off lightly.`
`After that, I had a sip of my drink and headed over to Maria and Jessica, who were gazing at the silhouette of the island.`
`"Uu!`
` Battler, saw the island, saw the island!`
` There there there!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Where is it...oh, I see it now.`
` Even after six years, the island hasn't changed a bit."`
`The small island's silhouette in front of us had gotten pretty close.`
`This island's name is Rokkenjima.`
`{n}It's a small island about ten kilometers around, located in the Izu Archipelago.`
`Since they call this archipelago "the Izu Seven", lots of people think there are seven islands, but that's not true.`
`There are actually more than seven.`
`{n}Rokkenjima is one of the minor islands that don't get counted.`
`Even considering that, there are probably very few people who know about this island.`
`After all, only the people of the Ushiromiya family come to this island.`
`In other words, it has no ties whatsoever to outsiders or tourists.`
`{n}So, you'll never find this island's name in a travel brochure.`
`This is because all of Rokkenjima is an estate possessed by the Ushiromiya head house.`
`Only the Ushiromiya family lives there, and only people connected to the Ushiromiya family come and go there.`
`There's nothing there except a harbor and a mansion.`
`{n}The vast majority of the island is still just uncultivated forest.`
`Such a waste, when it could be made into a nice golf course.`
`{n}However, when you realize that the entire coastline is a private beach, it starts to sound pretty magnificent.`
`You might have realized it by now, but to put it simply,`
` ......well, the Ushiromiya family is just rolling in dough.`
`The fortune possessed by the head house is apparently vast,`
` and Dad and the others who make up the branch families have built up plenty of wealth for themselves, finding success in their respective businesses.`
`I've been living a commoner's life at my grandparents' home these six years, so I'd completely forgotten,`
` ...but the old bastard's house really is elegant, and everything about it is tuned to match the snobbish tastes of the annoyingly rich.`
`Come to think of it, I guess that means George‐aniki, Jessica, Maria, and I are all wealthy, high‐class gentlemen and ladies.`
`Needless to say, none of us feel that way at all.`
`I don't see myself as being rich, and George‐aniki, who takes self‐discipline very seriously, doesn't let himself get too comfortable.`
`Jessica is always complaining that she'd rather move to the city than be rich,`
` and Maria is still a kid who isn't even interested in money at all.`
`...I guess that attitude itself is snobbish.`
`{n}From the perspective of people in poverty who can't pay the bills, we're very lucky to even have the luxury of thinking this way.`
`This isn't the place to explain any further, so I won't.`
`Anyway, it's the same as not being able to choose the parents you're born from.`
`{n}I didn't ask to be born into a rich family.`
`{n}And I don't think it's something I should be hated for.`
`It can be pretty trying when people are prejudiced against you just because you're rich and refuse to judge you by your merits...`
`As I pondered these sentimental thoughts, Maria leaned over the railing and started shouting.`
`"............Uu.`
` ......Gone."`
`"What's wrong, Maria?`
` Did you drop something?"`
`"Uu‐uu!`
` Gone, gone!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Maria kept yelling "gone, gone".`
`From her words alone, you would think she had perhaps dropped something, but she was actually pointing out over the ocean as she shouted.`
`"What's wrong?`
` What's gone?`
` I'll look for it too, if you want.`
` What is it?`
` ...............?"`
`If she'd dropped something, she would probably have looked down at the floor, but Maria was pointing out over the ocean.`
`One would assume that she had seen something out over the ocean, but she kept saying that something was {i:gone}.`
` .........Strange.`
`However, since my last memories of this place came from six years ago, I was able to spot it before Aniki, who comes here every year.`
`"............Huh...?`
` ......If I remember correctly, wasn't there a {c:86EF9C:torii} or something on top of a small crag around here?`
` ...That's right, it was definitely there.`
` I remember it well, since it's like a landmark, the first thing to greet you as you get closer to the island."`
`"Wow, you're amazing, Battler.`
` Even though it's been six years, you remembered."`
`"It was here, wasn't it...!`
` I remember too.`
` There used to be a shrine and a torii‐like thing standing all alone on that crag.`
` ......And now that you mention it, they are gone, aren't they.`
` They definitely were there last year, I think."`
`"Gone.`
` Gone.`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Maybe they were washed away by the waves or something?`
` It was a small crag, it probably got brittle because of its exposure."`
`"I think so too.`
` It actually disappeared during the summer.`
` Apparently—"`
`"A huge lightning bolt fell one evening and smashed the shrine, or some such...`
` ......The fishermen whisper that it must undoubtedly be an ominous sign, to have a thunderbolt fall upon our tutelary god.`
` ...Lightning begone, lightning begone..."`
`Kumasawa‐san smiled impishly as if teasing us, rubbing her hands together.`
`However, Maria was apparently taking it seriously,`
` and she stared fixedly over the ocean to where the crag enshrining the local guardian deity was supposed to be.`
`"............An ominous...sign.`
` ............Uu."`
`"Enough, Kumasawa‐san.`
` Maria isn't old enough to understand this kind of joke."`
`"It's alright, Maria‐chan.`
` It's just a coincidence.`
` Nothing scary's gonna happen."`
`George‐aniki put a hand on Maria's shoulder to calm her down, but Maria's sharp‐eyed expression didn't budge.`
`"............Ominous.`
` ............Ominous."`
`Maria muttered that word over and over.`
`{n}Apparently, repeating a single word over and over is a habit that Maria's had for a long time.`
`However, since the word she was saying was quite literally ominous, it was a bit creepy.`
`"Hey now, Maria.`
` Some disaster really will come if you say that word over and over, you know?"`
`I tapped Maria's other shoulder.`
`And then, Maria whipped her head around, stared into my face, and spoke unblinkingly.`
`"Uu.`
` .........Disaster...coming."`
`"Huh?`
` And just where is it coming from?"`
`I answered light‐heartedly, trying to break the tension in the air.`
`...And in reply, Maria held up a finger, raised her arm high, ...and pointed up to the heavens.`
`When I looked up, I saw that the sky was still just as cloudy, but it had grown a great deal more leaden than it had been that morning.`
`That's right—they were saying that a typhoon was approaching.`
`...We had planned to spend one night on the island, but if this storm doesn't pass quickly, I won't be able to make it to school on Monday.`
`{n}Well, I guess it makes for a pretty good excuse to be absent.`
`".....................Uu..."`
`...She apparently sensed something ominous in this cloudy sky.`
`{n}She's been muttering for a while now.`
`Girls at Maria's age tend to be very impressionable.`
`{n}She's just about the age when many girls start to get excited about sixth senses and whether they have any psychic potential and stuff.`
`...In a way, being sensitive about things like this isn't really out of the ordinary for a kid like her.`
`"It's alright, Maria‐chan.`
` The weather might get worse around tonight, but tomorrow it'll clear up and become a pretty blue sky."`
`"Uu.`
` Pretty blue sky.........`
` .........Uu..."`
`"That's right, by tomorrow it'll be a pretty blue sky.`
` There's no rain that doesn't end, and no clouds that never clear."`
`"Uu...`
` .........Rain that doesn't end.`
` ...Clouds that never clear.`
` ..................Uu........."`
`"Sure, the typhoon's coming, but it'll be gone before you know it!`
` It's alright, Maria."`
`"...............Uu.`
` ...Uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Maria started yelling "uu‐uu".`
`{n}...It looked as though she was having a tantrum because no one could understand what she was trying to say.`
`What in the world is Maria trying so desperately to warn us about?`
`Unable to understand her, we could do nothing but feel a vague sense of foreboding...`
`......I've heard that everyone can feel the supernatural, but that it weakens as you age.`
`That might mean that Maria, the youngest one of us all, still possessed some kind of sense that the rest of us had lost.`
`...I wonder if that sense is sending her a warning.`
`At that moment, Kumasawa‐san quietly opened her mouth.`
`".........Rumor has it...`
`that long ago, Rokkenjima was—"`
`"Kumasawa‐san.`
` Let's not talk about that now."`
`Just as Kumasawa‐san was about to tell some kind of story, Jessica sharply interrupted her.`
`For Jessica, this was an extremely firm reaction.`
`I wanted to push her further, just out of simple curiosity,`
` but judging by how Jessica was acting, it wasn't difficult to imagine that it would simply inflame Maria's unease further.`
`...If I did try to press her for the story, the odds were pretty good that it wouldn't be anything bright and cheery.`
`"......Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I do apologize about that...`
` ...The wind here is hard to bear for the elderly, so if you would excuse me for now..."`
`Gossipers have no reason to hang around after they've been told to stop chatting.`
`When Kumasawa‐san finally realized that she'd overstepped her bounds, she went back inside the boat.`
`After she left, Uncle Hideyoshi came along to replace her.`
`Since he'd shown up partway through, he completely failed to notice the complicated atmosphere that hung about the scene,`
` so he refreshingly and unwittingly swept that atmosphere aside.`
`So, in the end, it was his unwittingness that brightened the mood.`
`"Looks like we're almost there!`
` Alright, just a little more!`
` Took forever at the speed we went today, didn't it?`
` You all know whose fault that is!`
` Wahhahahahaha!"`
`"Aww, Uncle Hideyoshi, gimme a break already~...hahaha~!"`
`"Ahaha, keep on twisting the knife.`
` Seriously, 'cause of Battler, it's takin' fore~ver!"`
`".........Uu."`
`Maria had probably come to the conclusion that no one was going to listen to her.`
`She hung her head, wearing a fretful face.`
`As she did, George‐aniki crouched down to meet her eyes and spoke to her kindly.`
`"Maria‐chan.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of.`
` Because we're all together.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're together.`
` Go ahead and say it."`
`"............Uu.`
` ...There's nothing to be afraid of...if we're together..."`
`"Yes.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're together."`
`"............Uu."`
`"Yeah, George‐aniki knows what he's talking about.`
` If we're all together, there'll absolutely never be anything at all to be scared of.`
` Right, Jessica?"`
`"Yeah, no doubt about that.`
` George nii‐san always tells the truth, Maria."`
`"......Uu.`
` George onii‐chan always true."`
`"Yes.`
` I don't lie.`
` So trust me.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together."`
`"Uu.`
` ......George onii‐chan doesn't lie.`
` I trust you.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together.`
` .........Uu, not afraid!"`
`Maria jumped into George‐aniki's arms and hugged him tightly.`
`After Aniki patted her head, she jumped away again.`
`Her facial expression had returned so completely to normal that she looked like a totally different person from moments before.`
`{n}She was once again the ordinary Maria.`
`"Uu.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of anymore, because we're all together.`
` ...Uu‐uu."`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` ...You look all better now.`
` You're strong, Maria, good girl!"`
`"......Uu!`
` {c:86EF9C:I'm} a good girl!"`
`"Hey now, what's goin' on here?`
` Maria‐chan didn't get seasick, did she?`
` Hm?"`
`"Hahaha, well, something like that.`
` We'll be arriving soon."`
`The harbor was already drawing near.`
